- [Ben Kimo Twichell](http://www.iambent.com/), for his kind and patient help in solving nasty bugs: https://github.com/adrienjoly/chrome-next-track-for-trello/issues/1

- [Mathieu Grac](http://www.mathieugrac.com/), Dominique Decotter, Xavier Dorémus, Anthony Rodriguez, Merlin Nimier-David, and Camille Betinyani, for feedback
- and [Lailo](https://twitter.com/lailo_ch), for having encouraged me to turn this idea into a product, using [Pitchcard](http://pitchcard.io)!

If you think that I forgot you, I'm very sorry about that, and please let me know so that I can add you to this list, with pleasure! :-)
